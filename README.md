This is a basic app where I retrieve and show movies poster from The Movie DataBase in the Home screen, and save favorites in a different screen.<br>
To use this app you will need to create your own API key on https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started.<br>
After you have your API key you can save it in the .env file.
